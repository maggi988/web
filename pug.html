<center><h1><b>PUG</b></h1> 
<div class="t">
<p> The Pug is a breed of dog originally from China, with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colors, most often fawn (light brown) or black, and a compact, square body with well developed and thick muscles all over the body.
Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart.In the United Kingdom, in the nineteenth century, Queen Victoria developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of the Royal Family.
Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs.The American Kennel Club describes the breed's personality as "even-tempered and charming".Pugs remain popular into the twenty-first century, with some famous celebrity owners.</p>
