<h2>Why do Dogs Bark?</h2>
<p>Barking is a way for dogs to communicate with other dogs and with humans. Fierce barking or growling often signals that dogs are being territorial, feel threatened, or simply want to be left alone. However, dogs also bark when they are 
bored and want attention from other dogs or from humans.</p>

<h2>Why do dogs sniff other dogs’ rear ends?</h2>
<p>A dog may sniff other dogs’ rear ends to gather chemical information that helps the sniffer identify them as individuals. Gland-lined sacs, housed internally on either side of a dog’s anus, produce a scent that contributes to each dog’s unique odour profile. That profile may also indicate genetic makeup,
 reproductive status, diet, and emotional state.</p>

<h2>How are dog years calculated?</h2>
<p>Many people have learned that one human year equals roughly seven dog years. However, this is a huge oversimplification. How a dog ages is based largely on its size and breed. Smaller dogs tend to age “slower” than larger dogs. Also, the aging rate of some breeds, such as beagles, differs from 
that of other similarly sized breeds.</p>
